Approach and Process
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
What in my process and approach to this project would I do differently next time?
I would plan out the requirements of my project as opposed to writing functions as required. I spent a lot of time trying to incorporate functions only for it to break somewhere else. Also, I spent considerable time refactoring my code so as to make it manageable and readable.

What in my process and approach to this project went well that I would repeat next time?
Towards the later phase of the project, I began to encapsulate features of my project in functions which allowed me to reuse code.

Code and Code Design
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
What in my code and program design in the project would I do differently next time?

I would try to plan my code better such as thinking about what I want to achieve rather than planning and coding on the go. It would save me a lot of effort instead of having to duplicate chunks of code. For example, when I created several setIntervals when one setInterval would work.

Button key generation which never found its way into the main code (poor game planning)

Cycling several functions through a setInterval resulting in reduced performance (coding my requirements on the go instead of proper planning)

Massive chunk of code to perform object collisions(this is due to improper  planning)
https://github.com/MadnessAntipathy/maze/commit/ee198872602160e55b632480e04e271f6797b4f6#diff-9a9569e9d73f33740eada95275da7f30R692


What in my code and program design in the project went well? Is there anything I would do the same next time?

Refactoring my code helped me in better using my functions. I still have a long way to go to clean up the rest of my code.

WDI Unit 1 Post Mortem
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
What habits did I use during this unit that helped me?
I kept asking myself what were the requirements of the function. That guided me through the thought process of coding the requirement

What habits did I have during this unit that I can improve on?
Rushing into coding instead of planning out my project and what each function required.

How is the overall level of the course during this unit? (instruction, course materials, etc.)
I think it is sufficient to cover the basics of implementing a simple game. Akira and his team helped me understand game development better which I was then able to use their knowledge to build my game.
